## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Your security is important, and sensitive details should always be reported privately.

Please report potential vulnerabilities using one of the following **private** methods:

1.  **(Recommended)** Use [**GitHub Security Advisories**](https://github.com/shaharia-lab/echoy/security/advisories). This is the preferred method as it allows for private discussion and tracking directly within GitHub.
2.  **(Alternative Private Method)** Email us directly at **hello@shaharialab.com**. Please use this for **sensitive vulnerability details**. Use a clear subject line like "Security Vulnerability Report for echoy".

**What to include in your private report:**

* A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or prerequisites.
* Proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or logs if applicable.
* The version(s) of `echoy` affected.
* Any potential mitigations or workarounds you are aware of.

**Public Discussion Channel (Not for Sensitive Reports):**

For general security questions or discussions (but **NOT** for reporting undisclosed sensitive vulnerabilities), you can also find us on our **[#echoy Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/1346487271225954384/1358845326580252713)**. Please remember this is a public channel, so do not share sensitive information there before it has been privately reported and addressed.

## Our Process

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your private vulnerability report within **[e.g., 2-3 business days]**.
2.  **Assessment:** We will investigate the report to confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity.
3.  **Updates:** We will strive to keep you informed of our progress during the investigation and remediation process via the private channel you used.
4.  **Remediation:** We will work to develop and release a patch for the vulnerability in a timely manner, prioritizing based on severity.
5.  **Disclosure:** Once a fix is available, we may coordinate public disclosure with you. We typically aim to disclose vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories after a patch is released. We appreciate responsible disclosure practices that allow users time to update before full technical details are made public.

We value your contributions to keeping `echoy` secure!
